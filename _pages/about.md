I am a postdoc at Stanford University, interested in how we can use machine learning to improve climate models. I am currently working on gravity wave parameterizations, which are used to represent the subgrid-scale portion of the gravity wave spectrum in climate models. 

My main interests include machine learning and Bayesian statistics.
