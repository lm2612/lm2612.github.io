We are hosting the model hierarchies workshop at Stanford. I am presenting my research on calibration of climate models, motivated by the concept of using complex, high resolution models to constrain idealized climate models. This workshop inspired [this paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023MS003715) which discusses how the climate model hierarchy is evolving with the growing interest in machine learning and in catastrophe modeling for impacts.
