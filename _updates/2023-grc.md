---

The [Gordon Research Conference](https://www.grc.org/radiation-and-climate-conference/2023/) is taking place in Maine this year. I am session leader for the model hierarchies session, where I will introduce the topic of model hierarchies and the three exciting speakers on this topic. Find out more about model hierarchies in [our paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023MS003715).
