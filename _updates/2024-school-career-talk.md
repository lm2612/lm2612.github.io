## A trip to a local high school 

I visited a local high school to give a talk about why I became a scientist and what I do day-to-day. We talked about physics, fluid dynamics, career choices, climate models, and even Minecraft! I met many motivated students and really enjoyed hanging around to discuss with them at the end. Thank you to the organisers for inviting me!
