excerpt: I started a new position as a postdoc at Stanford University
---
I've moved from the UK to sunny California to start a new position as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in Aditi Sheshadri's group [atmospheric dynamics, variability, and change](eddy.stanford.edu).
I will be working on gravity wave parameterizations, using similar methods I used during my PhD 
(e.g., machine learning, emulation, Gaussian processes, uncertainty quantification).
