excerpt: I attended the EGU 2025 General Assembly.

I just got back from Vienna for the EGU 2025 General Assembly. The week was very exciting and enjoyed attending many talks and posters. 
I gave an invited talk on [Uncertainty Quantification of Machine Learning Parameterisations](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/EGU25-12129.html), showing results on quantifying parametric uncertainties in a machine learning emulator for atmospheric gravity waves and the resulting uncertainty on stratospheric circulation.
I was also a co-convener of a session on [Advancing Earth System Models using Machine Learning](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/session/54133), where we gained insights into how others are using machine learning to improve climate models and their workflows. The room was jam packed!
I had a great time discussing the recent advances in the field of machine learning for climate modelling. And Vienna was also lovely!
