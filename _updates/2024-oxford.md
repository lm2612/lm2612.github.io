## New position as a postdoctoral fellow at University of Oxford

I'm excited to announce I have officially moved back to the UK. I've been awarded the Schmidt AI in Science fellowship to carry out research in uncertainty quantification in machine learning climate model components. I have absolutely loved every minute of my time at Stanford and I feel incredibly grateful to have spent almost 3 years there surrounded by many wonderful people. But now I am ready to get started on more independent research in an equally exciting (although much wetter) place!
