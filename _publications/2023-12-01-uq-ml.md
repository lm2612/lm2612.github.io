I am currently working on an approach to quantify uncertainties arising from machine learning gravity subgrid-scale parameterizations. This is still in prep, but I will make an early pre-print available [here](http://lm2612.github.io/files/WavenetUQ.pdf) in late December/early January.

Please reach out to me for more information or with any feedback/comments at lauraman@stanford.edu.
